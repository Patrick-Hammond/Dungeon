[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/html5-boilerplate.svg?branch=barebones)](https://travis-ci.org/dakom/html5-boilerplate)

This is just a barebones version of the master branch

The core commands for building and testing work (`npm run dev`, `npm run test:dev`, `npm run test:dist`)

For all other stuff, you can build up from here or strip away/expand from the master branch :)

For small projects this is probably a better starting point, since it's easier to copy/paste a couple libs than to figure out what you _don't_ need ;)
